# OpenCV-Based Robot Ball and Turtle Control Using C and JavaScript

This project showcases a web-based application for controlling robot balls and turtle graphics using OpenCV (C) and JavaScript. It provides users with the ability to manually control both the robot balls and a turtle (using OpenCV's drawing functionality) through a simple web interface.

## Features

- **Manual Robot Ball and Turtle Control**: Control the movement of robot balls and the turtle using a web interface.
- **OpenCV Integration (C)**: Utilize OpenCV (C) for controlling and drawing turtle graphics and processing the robot ball movements.
- **JavaScript Front-End**: A user-friendly interface for controlling the robot balls and turtle.
- **Webcam Feed**: Live webcam video feed for visual feedback during control.

## Prerequisites

- **C Compiler**: Required to compile OpenCV-based C code.
- **OpenCV (C)**: Ensure OpenCV is installed with support for turtle graphics and object tracking.
- **Node.js**: To run the JavaScript-based web interface.
